# Personal distroboxes

A place to hold the configuration for, and CI/CD to build, my own personal distroboxes.

This is intended to be an extremely opinionated set of configuration for my own personal use-cases.
This should generally be assumed to be used in conjunction with my [.dotfiles](https://github.com/kirikae/.dotfiles)

This repo is effectively a fork from the work found here: [ublue-os/boxkit](https://github.com/ublue-os/boxkit/tree/main)
